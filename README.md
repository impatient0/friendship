# HELLO MY DEAR FRIEND!!!

Hopr you're excited to learn about GIT cause that's what we're gonna do here.

## BUT WHAT IS GIT??

Wouldn't you like to know! Git is a VCS (version control system) created by none other than [Linus Torwalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus!"). Why is it called "git"? According to Linus himself, it can mean, depending on your mood:

-random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.

-stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.

-"global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.

-"goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.
